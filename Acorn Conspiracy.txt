			`Upon landing on Greenwater, you find the planet's directory and search for the Science Division.`
			`	When you figure out the location, you take a taxi to the building.`
			`	When you enter, a few Hai are there to greet you. they seem to be expecting you. "Are you captain <first> <last>? Come with us please"`

			`	You are brought into a room full of graphs and charts "This is the data we have compiled about the shortage." They motion towards a chart but you arent really paying attention.`
			`	You go and look at one of the charts. It's clearly more complicated than your brain can comprehend. The scientists see you peering at the wrong chart and direct you to the correct one.`
			`	"As you can see, the number of acorns and oak trees has been steadily falling since a few months ago. Numbers today ae so low, that the Hai government has declared a State of Emergency."`
			choice
				`	"Have you any idea what's happening with the trees?"`
				`	"Do you know why the numbers just suddenly started falling?"`
			`	"That's the problem. We don't. We were hoping you could find out."`
			`	The other scientist, who until now has been silent, chimes in.`
			`	"We need you to go around testing the remaining trees in 3 of the most affected areas. We hope to find what's causing their drop in numbers."`

				`	You have reached your first stop. You take the equipment the scientists gave you and start tesing trees. A few Hai approach you.`
				`	"What are you doing?" one asks. "I'm testing trees to see why they've been dying."`
				`	"Dying? The trees haven't been dying. They just... disappear."`
				`	"Disappear?" you ask. "Correct. They seem to go away in the night." Something fishy's going on here, and you're going to find out what.`
